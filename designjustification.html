		  <h2 class="subheading">DESIGN ELEMENTS</h2>
  <div class="row">
		<div class="col">
			<p class="text-body backgroundblock4 text-testimonial"> One of the most dominant design elements we focussed on with creating and designing the website was <b class="backgroundblock">contrast.</b> Our main colour palette (the pink and blue) are already heavily contrasting tones and so within the website we had to take this into consideration with making the text readable and to not distract the viewer from the natural flow of the website. <br><br>

Through creating contrast between the colourful background we aimed to create <b class="backgroundblock">emphasis</b> on the important texts and key elements of our brand. Emphasis, as a design principle, deals with the parts of a design that are meant to stand out and for us it was incredibly important to clearly highlight for viewers that there are two different consumer segments we are targeting. This is why we made a clear distinction between participants and “distributors” on the home page.<br><br>

We also heavily relied on the design element <b class="backgroundblock">proportion</b> when designing our website. Our brand Mind Label has an extremely visual aesthetic which is why we used the design element proportion to lead the website’s viewers through a visual journey. We then minimally used the element <b class="backgroundblock">repetition</b> to keep our viewers engaged and surprised about what they will come across on the different pages of our website. This conceptually matches with our brand’s message, which is about moving your mind, opening up your perspective. With this we do not imply that the website lacks consistency as we stuck strictly to our fonts, colours and basic organization (e.g. all Archivo Black headers are white).

      <h5 class="card-title thee">CHOICE OF FONTS</h5>
	  <p class="text-body"> The Google Fonts we used on our website are <i class="bundletext">Archivo Black</i> and <b><i>quicksand.</i></b> As mentioned before, this is also a great example of the strong <b class="backgroundblock">contrast</b> we wanted to create to represent our creativity and diversity. <b class="bundletext">Archivo Black</b> is a font which is very powerful: bold, fixed and forthcoming. <b><i>Quicksand</i></b> on the other hand, represents more calm, cute and airy. These two fonts reinforce each other again by the difference. It was important that they both come across as powerful for the content. In this way we could indicate even more clearly the difference regarding titles and paragraphs. <br>
<br>
By using only these two fonts, we achieved a consistently looking website.
We used <i>sans serif</i> fonts because we learned last year that this best for readability for web and digital content. <i>(Source: Laura Pardo)</i> <br><br>
We used different sizes and styles within these font families. This creates Hierarchy according to the Design Principles. <br>

		 <img src="images/styleguide.png" class="card-img-bottom" alt="style guide of mind label">
		<p class="text-body"><br>
We developed our <b>style guide</b> during our assignment for Brand Developmet (Road Map.) We concluded very soon this would be an outstanding style. We picked some bright and overwhelming colours to express the creativity of the brand. We didn’t want to go with a dull pallet since part of our vision concluded fighting close-mindedness. </p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title thee">USE OF COLOURS</h5>
	  <p class="text-body">These highly contrasting colours also represent the strong diversity we want to share throughout the world. These colours gave us the opportunity to highlight and separate content intensely.<br><br>
 The muted red on the website is energetic without being aggressive. Blue is also used extensively to represent responsibility. Dark  blues are more strong and reliable. Blue is also associated with peace and has spiritual and religious connotations in many cultures and traditions (for example, the Virgin Mary is generally depicted wearing blue robes).Purple  is a combination of red and blue and takes on some attributes of both. It’s associated with creativity and imagination, too. Light purples  are softer and are associated with spring and romance. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/" class="hyperlinks1">Click here for the source.</a> Every Background contains this same gradient. According to the Design Principles this creates Unity. This is part of the site’s identity.

With these wireframes we also took into consideration the possibilities and limitations of the tools/ gadgets available on Bootstrap, but also tried to think outside of the box (for example: on our “Our Story” page included an interactive element that previews our brand’s Instagram feed).<br>

We asked both parents and friends to participate to get a wide range of ages (so people with different technical abilities and habits) to go through our website. We had 8 people test our website and adapted the website after we received their feedback to enhance the overall appeal and user-friendliness of our website! <br><br>
				
				We created a survey that instructed the participant to go through each page, interact with it and then state what they liked and/or disliked about it.

			 <ol type="1" class="text-body">
			 
			<li>I like the information that the home page gives and the option to choose between exploring or partner.</li>
<li>I like the container with the image and that it is clear what everything is about. I dislike the image that is overlapping the text at are you an explorer.</li>
<li>Love the colours and photo collage, demo is inviting. </li>
<li>Really visual, I really like it. with the video and the text it is clear what you company is about. however, by using terms like explorer and future partner it is maybe a bit hard to find out what that means exactly. but I really like that you have your own "terminology" it makes the brand unique!</li>
<li>I love the visuals! The whole 'collage' aesthetic is very appealing and catches your eye immediately. I don't dislike anything.</li>
<li>I like the video! Really shows the product.</li>
<li>Ik vind alle kleuren heel mooi en duidelijk <em>translation: “I like all the colours, very bright and clear.”</em></li>

			<li>I really liked the visualization of the history of mindlabel.</li>
<li>I like the carousel, and the story of yours</li>
<li>Nice original time line, beautiful instagram feed, but get a bit distracted by typos</li>
<li>Really cool with the carrousel with your journey! the page is visually very appealing and all info that you would want to find there is there! also nice links to other pages that fit with what you are thinking when you are on the page!</li>
<li>The moving timeline is great! I think that's a really nice interactive element that also shows your capabilities with HTML coding.</li>
<li>I like the timeline.</li>
<li>Goede afwisseling alleen lettertype groter doen bij de optie balk voor verder te klikken enzo. Translation: <em>Good switch-up, only the font should be bigger at the slideshow for clicking further etc.</em> </li>
<li>It's nice to see the Instagram feed on the 'Our Story' page also the fact that you see a roadmap with the people that worked on the Mind Label website. (tip: perhaps change the letter font for the regular text or make it a little bit smaller)

			 <ol type="1" class="text-body">
			 
			<li>I like that there is three options to choose but I would like to see a bit more options as in which countries are available.</li>
<li>I like the carousel at top and that you have different ones. </li>
<li>Nice bundle options. </li>
<li>I like the slide show with photo's it really makes the page visual also nice bundles, clear what they stand for and how they differ. also nice to have a contact part immediately there so you can contact the brand when interested immediately. Though it does say I accept the terms and conditions whilst I cannot find any anywhere?</li>
<li>Again, I really like the visuals. The bundles shown through different colours of the logo is a professional, high-quality way of demonstrating your services. The only thing with this page is that some photos in the top header are not very good quality but I'm not sure if that is intentional?</li>
<li>Clearly categorized! Maybe some more room at the sides.</li>
<li>Ziet er goed uit <em>translation: “Looks good.”</em></li>
				 <li>The colors and great and everything is easy to find and to understand. Perhaps the contact us part could have its own page.

			<li>This page feels honest and the quotes feel real. This is most of the times not the case on review pages but this feels genuinely real.</li>
<li>I like the review boxes, with the stars and customer reviews.</li>
<li>Clear review page</li>
<li>Very clear and nice real reviews! nice to read through it really well done</li>
<li>Reviews look awesome! I think the whole aesthetic of your website is very consistent, which shows a brand that knows their visual identity to its core.</li>
<li>Very clear.</li>
<li>Ziet er goed uit Translation: <em>Looks good. </em> </li>

		<p class="text-body"> After receiving all of this feedback we decided to change the following, in order to make our website more user-friendly. 
<ol class="text-body">
	<li><u>NAVIGATION:</u> A lot of users were struggling with the navigation because we had forgot to add the “active” class to each individual page, meaning that each time the navigation bar would indicate that you were on the HOME page, even though you might have clicked on the review page.</li>
	<li><u>TYPO’S:</u> We adjusted the spelling areas that the users noted on the “Our Story” page.</li>
	<li><u>TERMS AND CONDITIONS:</u> Users could not find the link to our terms and conditions that we mention in the contact part of the “bundles page”. We added a link to clarify what the users are agreeing to before they submit their question or message.</li>
